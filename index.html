            <div class="About-Me">
                <p> Hello everyone! 
                    <br>
                    I am Alex, and I come from France!
                    
                    I would define myself as an easy-going person. 
                    I like my friends, my family, traveling, and learning. 
                    I also draw and read in my freetime.
                    I am always (or almost!) in a good mood! 
                    My friends would describe me as someone reliable, caring and friendly. 
                    <br>
                    At the beginning of August 2022, I decided to take some time 
                    to reflect on myself, where I was going, what I wanted to do 
                    in my life, etc. 
                    I started to get informed about tech and all jobs related to it. 
                    I have read a lot, started to study basics in different subjects 
                    (UI/UX, Data Analytics, Basics of Programming for example).
                    And here I am a few months later! 
                    <br>
                    End of September 2022, 
                    I started studying Data Science in a Bootcamp at <a href="https://www.wbscodingschool.com/" target="_blank">WBS School</a> and 
                    taking some classes on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>.

                    <p>VIU was my first experience in Germany. 
                        I started to work on top of my studies in June 2017. 
                        My manager needed some employee in the shipping department 
                        and I got hired full time. Completely new topic for me but thanks 
                        to a really nice team, I have learned a lot and understood all 
                        processes pretty fast. After a bit more than a year, I could get 
                        to the position of Supervisor since the teams were growing. 
                        <br>
                        I started my first real leadership job and started to enjoy it.
                        The company provided some classes and group lessons to become 
                        better. After again a year, I took over the full logistic department
                        and was responsible also for the warehouse and quality control teams.
                        <br>
                        I became a year later co-Leader of the full European Operations of VIU
                        which I really enjoyed. Full of challenges, and a lot more to learn, I stayed
                        at this position for a bit more than a year. Beginning of 2022, I decided 
                        to leave to embrace new challenges, it was time for me to start to get to know
                        another way to work, in a new company.

                        <p>Kiabi is a big fashion store in France with clothes and 
                            accessories for everyone in the family. This was a really
                            interesting experience since stores are really big and really 
                            successful. I was mostly at the cash or at the fitting rooms. 
                            I liked the way it was pretty full, days were flying! 
                            <br>
                            I also got the chance to make an internship there as Assistant 
                            Manager. I could plan and organise a 'VIP' evening for our 
                            best clients. I also thought about improving the NPS from the store
                            by rearranging the size+ area from the store.
